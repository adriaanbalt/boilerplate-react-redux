# Hello!  My name is Adriaan Balt and I built this blog platform from scratch using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in about 8-10 working hours.

## You can find more information about me at:
* [website](http://www.adriaanbalt.com) 
* [resume](http://www.adriaanbalt.com/assets/Adriaan-Balt-resume.pdf)
* [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adriaanbalt) 
* [Github profile](https://github.com/adriaanbalt)

## Things I would have liked to get to:
* Flesh out the i18n helper to make the hard coded copy easier to translate
* Implement related posts at the bottom of each article
* Enable sharing functionality of some sort
* Maybe built a drawer for mobile but not sure what I would put in it. (maybe my list of favorite articles...)
* I would have liked to animate between sort and search lists (although I'm happy I have cross fade between the screens)
* A backend possibly built with Node
* The ability to make comments on the posts
* Add analyzer to review bundle sizes


## Strange things
* There is a warning from router but the creators of React Router haven't fixed it yet, not sure why that is the case. [See more here](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/6382)

## How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
